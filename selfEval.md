# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges? **Feels great**
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.? **Workflow is good so far, I will be working to use my calendar more and try and take more notes on paper**
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1? **I will remember that you can store objects within arrays.**
